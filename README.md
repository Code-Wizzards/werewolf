# Werewolf Web App

We want to make an app that can replace God in the popular murderous game Werewolf, so you can play with only 7 people, or larger groups where no one particularly wants to run the game. Inspired by playing Werewolf on Zoom during these lockdown days. 

This is a side / learning project and shuffling along at a casual pace!
